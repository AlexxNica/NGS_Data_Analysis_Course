# NGS Data Analysis Course 2015

This repository contains all course materials for the HBC NGS Data Analysis Course.

This course is aimed at bench biologists who are interested in learning about NGS-based genomic analysis. The topics covered in-depth during this course are analysis of RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq data, with an optional Variant Calling session. The sessions will also include functional analysis downstream of sequence data processing. During this course, participants will gain skills in the areas of:
 
* UNIX and basic shell scripting
* high-performance compute clusters, and 
* R for statistical analysis and data visualization. 

At the end of this course, participants can expect to have the expertise to independently run data analysis for sequencing experiments.

**No prior programming experience or command-line training is required.**

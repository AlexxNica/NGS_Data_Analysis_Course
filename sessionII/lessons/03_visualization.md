### Visualization

Index the BAM file for visualization with IGV:

    samtools index results/STAR/Mov10_oe_1__Aligned.sortedByCoord.out.bam

**Transfer files to your laptop using the command line**

We previously used FileZilla to transfer files from Orchestra to your laptop. However, there is another way to do so using the command line interface. _This option is only available for Mac and Linux users! PC users can use Filezilla._  Similar to the `cp` command to copy there is a command that allows you to securely copy files between computers. The command is called `scp` and allows files to be copied to, from, or between different hosts. It uses ssh for data transfer and provides the same authentication and same level of security as ssh. 

First, identify the location of the _origin file_ you intend to copy, followed by the _destination_ of that file. Since the origin file is located on Orchestra, this requires you to provide remote host and login information.

The following 2 files need to be moved from Orchestra to your local machine,
 
`results/STAR/Mov10_oe_1_Aligned.sortedByCoord.out.bam`,

`results/STAR/Mov10_oe_1_Aligned.sortedByCoord.out.bam.bai` 

```
$ scp user_name@orchestra.med.harvard.edu:/home/user_name/unix_oct2015/rnaseq_project/results/Mov10_oe_1_Aligned.sortedByCoord.out.bam* /path/to/directory_on_laptop
```


**Visualize**

* Start [IGV](https://www.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/download) _You should have this previously installed on your laptop_
* Load the Human genome (hg19) into IGV using the dropdown menu at the top left of your screen. _Note: there is also an option to "Load Genomes from File..." under the "Genomes" pull-down menu - this is useful when working with non-model organisms_
* Load the .bam file using the **"Load from File..."** option under the **"File"** pull-down menu. *IGV requires the .bai file to be in the same location as the .bam file that is loaded into IGV, but there is no direct use for that file.*

#### Exercise
Now that we have done this for one sample, let's try using the same commands to perform alignment on one of the control samples. Using `Irrel_kd_1_qualtrim25.minlen35.fq` walk through the alignment commands above. Copy over the resulting BAM and index file to your laptop and upload into IGV for visualization. 

1. How does the MOV10 gene look in the control sample in comparison to the overexpression sample?
2. Take a look at a few other genes by typing into the search bar. For example, PPM1J and PTPN22. How do these genes compare?
